# matlab-pronav
Pronav simulation script in 2 dimensions on MATLAB app designer.

Written in MATLAB app designer in R2023b for a classes final project. Written for 2 dimensions but expanding to 3
would not be that much work, just change vectors initialization and function outputs.  Uses ODE45 solver.  The animation
option is jank and very slow, if I ever feel like it I'll make it into a movie that can be replayed at will so animation is 
smoother.
